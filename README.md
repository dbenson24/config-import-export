This package allows you to save the configuration of the Atom text editor so that you can restore it at a later date.

Currently it is configured to save your backup to HOMEDIRECTORY/AtomBackups/backup.json and restore from there as well.
Ability to choose a specific export and import path as well as define names for the backup file will be incoming.
