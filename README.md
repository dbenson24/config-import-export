# Config Import Export

This package allows you to save the configuration of the Atom text editor so
that you can restore it at a later date.

You can specify a name and location for the backups to be saved, currently you
can only import backups from files in HOMEDIRECTORY/AtomBackups/ which is also
the default location for all backups to be saved to.
